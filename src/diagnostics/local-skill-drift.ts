/**
 * Local-skill drift detector — issue #613 finding 3.
 *
 * Complements `skill-pin-drift.ts`: that module checks live master vs
 * MCP-pinned (operator-side staleness signal — "this MCP build is
 * stale relative to the skill repo"). This module checks the USER's
 * local `SKILL.md` vs MCP-pinned (user-side staleness signal — "your
 * local skill clone is stale relative to this MCP build"), the case
 * the agent in #613 actually hit.
 *
 * **Why a separate notice**: when local and MCP differ, the skill's
 * Step 0 halts with `vaultpilot-preflight skill integrity check
 * FAILED — DO NOT SIGN.`. That message reads as a tamper alarm. In
 * practice, the overwhelmingly common cause is a stale `git clone`
 * the user hasn't pulled. Without a server-side hint disambiguating
 * "stale" from "tampered", the user sees the same scary halt for two
 * very different conditions.
 *
 * Disambiguation strategy: extract the version-sentinel embedded in
 * the local skill content (canonical pattern
 * `VAULTPILOT_PREFLIGHT_INTEGRITY_v<N>_<16-hex>`) and compare to the
 * MCP-pinned `EXPECTED_SKILL_SENTINEL_*`. Three branches:
 *
 *   - `match`: hash matches — no notice.
 *   - `version-stale`: hash differs AND a `_vN_` sentinel was
 *     extracted that names a different version → notice with `git
 *     pull` recipe and explicit "this is staleness, not tamper" copy.
 *   - `content-mismatch`: hash differs AND no sentinel could be
 *     extracted (e.g. pre-sentinel skill version) → notice with
 *     fail-safe wording: try `git pull` first; if hashes still
 *     differ, treat as tamper.
 *   - `read-failed` / skill absent: no notice (the missing-skill
 *     warning already covers absence; read errors fail soft).
 *
 * Read is synchronous — local FS, single small file. No async
 * scaffolding needed; called lazily from the first tool response so
 * we don't pay any cost when the skill isn't installed.

/**
