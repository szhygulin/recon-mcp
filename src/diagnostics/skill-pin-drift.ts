/**
 * Skill-pin drift detector — issue #379 design 4 (startup self-check).
 *
 * The MCP's `PREFLIGHT SKILL INTEGRITY PIN` block in the server-level
 * `instructions` field carries the SHA-256 of the canonical
 * `SKILL.md` from `vaultpilot-security-skill`'s `master`. When the
 * skill repo ships a new release, that pin needs a coordinated bump
 * here — the v0.4.1 / "Step 0 — Integrity self-check" rollout in the
 * skill repo turned every drift into a loud `vaultpilot-preflight
 * skill integrity check FAILED — DO NOT SIGN.` halt for users with a
 * current skill clone, so a stale server-side pin breaks signing
 * flows entirely.
 *
 * **What this module does**: at server startup, fetch the live
 * `SKILL.md` from `master`, sha256 it, compare against
 * `EXPECTED_SKILL_SHA256`. On drift, log to stderr AND register a
 * session-level `VAULTPILOT NOTICE — Skill pin drift detected` block
 * that fires on the first tool response per session (deduped, same
 * shape as the existing `Preflight skill not installed` notice).
 *
 * **What this is NOT**: a hard refusal layer. It's pure diagnostic —
 * the goal is to surface drift to the user / agent / operator BEFORE
 * a signing flow halts mid-prompt with `integrity check FAILED`. A
 * fully-compromised MCP would not run this check at all (same trust
 * floor as the rest of the server). Network failures fail-soft —
 * absent connectivity, the check just returns `fetch-failed` and the
 * server starts up normally.
 *
 * **Why `master`, not a tag**: the skill repo's release process pins
 * `master` as the source of truth for the SHA distributed in this
 * MCP's `instructions` block. Tags lag and would need their own
 * release-note pin update; this MCP can't realistically know which
 * tag corresponds to which `Expected SHA-256` value at any given
 * moment without parsing release notes. Using `master` directly is
 * what the existing skill-side `git pull` remediation path leans on.
 *
 * Source of truth for the constants: this module's exports. The
 * `instructions`-block PIN DATA section in `src/index.ts` reads
 * `EXPECTED_SKILL_SHA256` etc. from here, so the literal value
 * appears exactly once in the source tree.
