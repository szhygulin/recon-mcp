/**
 * `get_update_command` — surfaces the recommended upgrade flow for the
 * running install path so the agent has a concrete answer when the user
 * sees the `VAULTPILOT NOTICE — Update available` block (or asks
 * proactively, "is there a new version?").
 *
 * Returns a structured result the agent can act on:
 *   - `current`: this server's package.json version.
 *   - `latest`: the latest version returned by the most recent
 *     successful npm-registry fetch, or `null` if the lazy
 *     `version-check` kickoff hasn't resolved yet (or the env-var
 *     disabled it).
 *   - `updateAvailable`: strict-newer comparator, false when `latest`
 *     is `null`.
 *   - `installPath`: detected kind (`npm-global` / `npx` /
 *     `bundled-binary` / `from-source` / `unknown`) so the agent can
 *     judge how confident the recommendation is.
 *   - `command`: ready-to-paste upgrade command for the detected path.
 *   - `restartHint`: short note about the post-upgrade restart.
 *   - `note`: optional caveat — surfaces when `installPath` is
 *     `unknown` (defer to INSTALL.md) or `latest` is unknown (the
 *     agent should call back later or re-run when the registry is
 *     reachable).
 *
 * Pure local introspection plus a read of cached version-check state.
 * Never throws, never re-fetches the registry (the kickoff already
 * does that); safe to call any number of times.
