/**
 * Hardcoded allowlist of LiFi bridge tools whose `BridgeData.destinationChainId`
 * legitimately encodes an INTERMEDIATE settlement chain rather than the user's
 * final destination chain.
 *
 * Background
 * ----------
 * The default chainId-mismatch defense in `verifyLifiBridgeIntent` refuses
 * any cross-chain bridge calldata whose encoded `destinationChainId` doesn't
 * equal the LiFi chain ID for the user's requested `toChain`. That's the
 * right default — it's the layer that catches a compromised aggregator (or
 * upstream MCP) returning calldata that secretly routes funds to an
 * attacker-controlled chain.
 *
 * But some bridge protocols legitimately settle on an intermediate chain and
 * release on the final chain off-chain. NEAR Intents is the canonical
 * example: ETH→TRON USDT routes deposit into a NEAR-bridge contract on
 * Ethereum, settle on NEAR, and a relayer releases USDT-TRC20 to the user's
 * TRON address. The on-chain `destinationChainId` is NEAR's pseudo-id
 * (`1885080386571452`, similar pattern to Solana's `1151111081099710`),
 * even though the user's final destination is genuinely TRON.
 *
 * This module narrows the chainId-mismatch defense to permit ONLY
 * specifically-allowlisted (bridge name, intermediate chain ID) pairs. The
 * receiver-side checks in `verifyLifiBridgeIntent` still apply unchanged
 * (non-EVM sentinel for non-EVM destinations, or matching toAddress for EVM
 * destinations) — this allowlist only relaxes the chainId equality.
 *
 * Tamper resistance
 * -----------------
 * THE LITERAL CHAIN-ID VALUES BELOW ARE A SECURITY ANCHOR. They MUST be:
 *
 *   1. Hardcoded source-code constants — never loaded from env vars,
 *      `userConfig`, MCP tool args, or LiFi response data. All of those
 *      are within the compromised-MCP / hostile-aggregator threat model.
 *      A literal source-code constant is the only tamper-resistant
 *      location: an attacker cannot change it without rebuilding the
 *      binary the user is running, at which point they own everything
 *      anyway.
 *   2. Compared with `===` against an externally-supplied `bigint` —
 *      no arithmetic, no derivation. The decoded value either equals
 *      the literal or it doesn't.
 *   3. Pinned by a unit test (`intermediate-chain-bridges.test.ts`) so
 *      a developer typo / merge mishap that drifts the value is caught
 *      at CI time.
 *
 * Adding a new entry
 * ------------------
 * Adding a bridge to this allowlist materially expands the `prepare_swap`
 * trust surface. Every entry must satisfy:
 *
 *   1. The bridge is a real third-party protocol with a publicly-verifiable
 *      on-chain contract address and protocol docs.
 *   2. The intermediate chain ID is the bridge's canonical settlement
 *      chain ID as encoded by the bridge protocol itself — NOT inferred
 *      from a single LiFi response. Cross-check against the bridge's own
 *      docs and at least one independent route execution.
 *   3. The bridge name string is exactly LiFi's lowercase label for that
 *      tool (verified from a known-good LiFi response, NOT from the
 *      quote we're about to sign).
 *
 * Trust trade-off (consistent with existing non-EVM destinations)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * When this allowlist matches, we still REQUIRE
 * `receiver === NON_EVM_RECEIVER_SENTINEL` for non-EVM final destinations.
 * The actual destination address lives in the bridge-specific facet data
 * (which we do NOT decode), so we trust the bridge protocol to deliver to
 * the address LiFi packed in there. This is the SAME trust boundary we
 * already accept for ETH→Solana via Wormhole/Mayan and is documented in
 * `SECURITY.md`'s second-LLM verification flow as the user-side defense.
