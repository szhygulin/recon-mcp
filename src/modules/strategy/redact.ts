/**
 * Redaction-verify scan for shared strategies.
 *
 * The privacy guarantee `share_strategy` and `import_strategy` give —
 * "no addresses, no tx hashes, ever" — is enforced by this scan, not by
 * the serializer's hand-crafted shape. Reasoning:
 *
 *   - The serializer can be modified without anyone remembering a
 *     privacy invariant; a regex scan catches drift mechanically.
 *   - User-supplied free-form fields (`name`, `description`,
 *     `authorLabel`) ride through the same JSON, and a user could
 *     paste a wallet address into "name" by mistake. The scan stops
 *     it before emit.
 *   - Symmetric on import — a malicious sender can't sneak an address
 *     into a field the recipient might not eyeball.
 *
 * Patterns are de-anchored variants of the canonical shapes in
 * `shared/address-patterns.ts`. False positives are acceptable: a
 * legitimate 43-char base58 string in a `description` is rare enough
 * that throwing is the safer default — the user can rephrase.
