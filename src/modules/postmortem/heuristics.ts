/**
 * Post-mortem heuristics — "why might this surprise you?".
 *
 * Each rule looks at the populated `ExplainTxResult` and pushes a
 * heuristic entry when its condition matches. Rules are intentionally
 * simple and high-precision; the bar for surfacing one is "would the
 * user benefit from being told this?".
 *
 * Rules in v1:
 *   - `failed`: tx reverted on-chain.
 *   - `unlimited_approval`: any approval set MAX_UINT256 (or near it).
 *   - `dust_transfer`: outflow valueUsd < $0.01 — possible address
 *     poisoning bait (same family as #220).
 *   - `transfer_to_zero`: a Transfer event went to the zero address
 *     (token burn).
 *   - `high_gas`: fee USD > 10% of the largest absolute-USD balance
 *     change.
 *   - `no_state_change`: success status but zero state changes
 *     (suspicious noop or wallet probe).
