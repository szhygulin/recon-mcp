/**
 * In-memory registry of proposed Safe transactions, keyed by safeTxHash.
 *
 * Purpose: bind `submit_safe_tx_signature` to the EXACT SafeTx body that
 * `prepare_safe_tx_propose` constructed. Without this, the submit step
 * would have to re-derive `(to, value, data, nonce, ...)` from caller input
 * — at which point a prompt-injected agent could substitute different inner
 * args between approve and submit, making the on-chain `approveHash` tx the
 * user signed cover one inner call but the Safe Tx Service post a different
 * one. The server is the source of truth; the agent only passes the
 * safeTxHash forward.
 *
 * Lifetime: 30 minutes. Long enough for an `approveHash` tx to land on
 * mainnet under high gas competition (the `prepare_safe_tx_propose` returns
 * an UnsignedTx whose own handle has 15-minute TTL — so the user has 15 min
 * to broadcast, then up to ~15 min for inclusion before submit fails). Past
 * the TTL the SafeTx body is gone from the server and the user re-runs
 * `prepare_safe_tx_propose` to rebuild it.
