 *    `msg.sender == signer || approvedHashes[signer][hash] != 0`.
 *  - Signatures MUST be ordered by ascending owner address — the contract
 *    iterates `currentOwner > lastOwner` and reverts otherwise.
 *
 * The executor counts as their own signature when they're an owner (the
 * `msg.sender` clause of the contract check), so they don't need to have

 * (highest priority) so a cold-start execute by an owner just works.
