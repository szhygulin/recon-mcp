 *    agent never gets to substitute different calldata between prepare and
 *    propose. This is the canonical, secure path.
 *  - `to / value / data`: raw call fields, for ad-hoc contract calls that
 *    don't have a matching prepare_* tool (e.g. an obscure protocol's
 *    `claim()` method). `value` defaults to "0", `data` defaults to "0x".
 *  Both forms accept `operation` (CALL=0 default, DELEGATECALL=1).
 *
 * The two forms are mutually exclusive — the handler refuses requests that
 * pass both. Enforced at handler entry, not via `.refine`, so the MCP
 * inputSchema stays a flat ZodObject.
