/**
 * Broadcast a signed Solana tx to the network. Input is the full serialized
 * tx bytes (message + signature section). Output is the tx signature
 * (58-char base58, also the primary tx identifier on Solana).
 *
 * `skipPreflight: false` — default. The RPC runs a simulation before
 * submitting so obvious failures (insufficient balance, bad program
 * address, missing account) surface as an error up front rather than
 * landing on-chain and failing. Preflight is ~80ms extra; cheap insurance.
 *
 * `preflightCommitment: "confirmed"` — preflight-simulates against
 * `confirmed` cluster state so we don't false-positive on optimistically-
 * processed-then-reverted slots.
 *
 * `maxRetries: 5` — web3.js rebroadcasts the EXACT same signed bytes
 * (no re-sign; the tx signature is deterministic) against the RPC up to
 * 5 times within the blockhash's validity window. This tolerates the
 * common case where the first leader saw the tx but didn't include it —
 * subsequent leaders get another shot without the user re-approving on
 * the Ledger. We previously set this to 0 reasoning "surface transient
 * failures to the caller" — but the transient failure was silent drop,
 * not a returned error, so 0 retries meant one leader failure = lost tx.
 * Double-landing isn't a risk: Solana sigs are deterministic, so the
 * cluster dedupes identical broadcasts.

    //      tried to land. Re-preparing refetches samples at a newer slot
    //      and usually succeeds.

    //      emits "Rotating mega slot" when the feed is mid oracle-set
    //      transition; consensus is unreachable for ~60–120s regardless
    //      of sample count. Tight retry loops fail identically — the
