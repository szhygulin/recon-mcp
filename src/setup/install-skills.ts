/**
 * Auto-install the two companion Claude Code skills — `vaultpilot-preflight`
 * (signing-time bytes-verification invariants) and `vaultpilot-setup`
 * (conversational `/setup` flow) — into `~/.claude/skills/`. Replaces the
 * manual `git clone` step the user would otherwise run.
 *
 * Idempotent: if a skill's directory already exists with a `SKILL.md` file,
 * we leave it alone (never `git pull` silently — the user's trust root is
 * their local clone, so an opportunistic pull would undermine that). Users
 * who want to update re-run `git pull` from the skill dir manually.
 *
 * Non-fatal: if `git` isn't on PATH, or the network is down, or the skill
 * repo is unreachable, we emit a structured error result per skill and keep
 * going. The MCP's runtime "skill missing" notice still fires, so the user
 * has a second chance to install manually — setup-time failure doesn't
 * leave them stranded.
 *
 * Both repos are intentionally separate from `vaultpilot-mcp`. An attacker
 * who compromises the MCP release pipeline cannot modify the skills this
 * flow clones — their trust roots are the user's own clones of the skill
 * repositories. Documenting this invariant here is why we do NOT `git pull`
 * after the first successful clone.
