/**
 * Lazy first-run auto-install of the two companion skills (`vaultpilot-
 * preflight`, `vaultpilot-setup`) at MCP server startup, instead of (or in
 * addition to) the interactive `vaultpilot-mcp-setup` wizard.
 *
 * Why "first tool call" and not npm `postinstall`:
 *   - npm postinstall runs at install time, often as root when global npm
 *     has a rooted prefix → skills end up root-owned and Claude Code (user)
 *     can't update them.
 *   - postinstall doesn't fire under `--ignore-scripts` (a common security
 *     default in CI / corporate networks).
 *   - The bundled binary, brew, and Docker install paths skip npm entirely.
 *   - Silent network calls during `npm install` / `npx` cold-starts surprise
 *     users who didn't ask for github.com egress.
 * Lazy first-call install runs as the user across every install vector,
 * makes the network call when the user is actually using the MCP, and
 * preserves the deliberate "skills are an independent trust root" property
 * (still git-cloned from github, never bundled with this package).
 *
 * State machine (per skill):
 *
 *   not-attempted ──► in-progress ──► succeeded
 *           │                  │
 *           │                  └────► failed
 *           ▼
 *      already-present (skill dir + SKILL.md exist before kickoff)
 *
 * `not-attempted` covers the disabled-via-env-var case AND the pre-kickoff
 * state. `already-present` is terminal and quiet (skill is there; no notice).
 *
 * Honors `VAULTPILOT_DISABLE_SKILL_AUTOINSTALL=1` for users who want
 * air-gapped / no-egress operation. When set, kickoff is a no-op and the
 * existing manual-install notice fires (today's behavior).
