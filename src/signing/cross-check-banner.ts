/**
 * Cross-check banner — version + SHA-256 + canonical URL header for the
 * `pasteableBlock` rendered by `get_verification_artifact`.
 *
 * Why: the prior pasteableBlock body was ~80 lines of agent-task prose,
 * which a "lazy user" couldn't visually verify against prompt injection.
 * The redesigned block opens with a 3-line trust banner the user pins
 * once and skims in 3 seconds on every subsequent invocation; the full
 * audit spec moves to `docs/cross-check-v1.md` (committed to the repo,
 * referenced by URL pinned to the package version tag).
 *
 * The banner shows:
 *   1. Spec version + SHA-256 of the on-disk doc — pin once, abort on mismatch
 *   2. Canonical URL on github.com/szhygulin/vaultpilot-mcp pinned to the
 *      package's release tag, so the spec the user reads online matches
 *      the one shipped in their installed package
 *   3. End separator
 *
 * Compromise model:
 *   - Hostile MCP swaps the spec body but keeps the SHA: SHA mismatches
 *     against what the user pinned in `~/.vaultpilot-mcp/config.json` and
 *     the agent surfaces it in the prepare receipt.
 *   - Hostile MCP swaps the URL: the user notices it's not
 *     `szhygulin/vaultpilot-mcp` (the install footprint they trust).
 *   - Hostile MCP swaps both: same threat surface as a fully replaced
 *     npm package — the user's first-install verification step is the
 *     trust anchor regardless of this banner.
