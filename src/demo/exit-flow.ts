/**
 * Demo → operational handoff guide. The MCP server can't *invoke* the
 * setup wizard (a separate interactive binary) or modify the user's
 * `claude mcp add` config — it can only describe what to do. This module
 * builds a structured, decision-tree-shaped response the agent walks the
 * user through to leave demo mode and configure real signing.
 * bump
 *
 * Surfaced via the `exit_demo_mode` tool. The agent's job is to ASK the
 * user the relevant questions first (do you have a Ledger? which chains?),
 * then call this with their answers; the response is tailored to skip
 * sections that don't apply.
 *
 * Stateless / read-only — does NOT actually unset VAULTPILOT_DEMO or
 * mutate any process state. Demo mode is read from env at every tool call
 * and the only real "exit" is restarting the MCP server with the env var
 * absent. The tool's response makes that constraint explicit.
